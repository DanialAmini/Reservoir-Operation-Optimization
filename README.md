Optimization of Water-Supply and Hydropower Reservoir Operation Using the CSS Algorithm


The CSS algorithm is a metaheuristic optimization method inspired by the governing laws of electrostatics in physics and motion from the Newtonian mechanics. The CSS algorithm is then to optimally solve the water-supply and hydropower operation of “Dez” reservoir in southern Iran over three different operation periods of 60, 240, and 480 months. Here the codes are presented for the 480-month operations.
